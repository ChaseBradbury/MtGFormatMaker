Make your own formats!

First you need to add cards.

There are 4 tabs at the top, which all add cards (or save):
  1. Upload a JSON that contains a card list, with 2 options
    - Add the entire file
    - Add a number random cards from the file 
  2. Add an individual card
  3. Add cards using a scryfall query, with 2 options
    - Add a full page of results (each page is 175 cards)
    - Add a number random cards that match the criteria
  4. Save the format as a JSON (you can then re-add that JSON next time)

You can close the top purple panel when you’re done adding cards, by clicking the currently open tab.

If you need to delete a card, check the Edit Format toggle, then hover over the card and click the trashcan icon.
You can also clear the format, which will delete all the cards.

Clicking on the name of a card will open that card’s scryfall page in a new tab, and clicking the image will add the card to a “deck”.
(Currently the deck is just a list on the right side of the page to help you remember cards)

Filter the cards by name, type, cmc, artist (though only for the version added), colors, and rules.

When you’re happy with the format, go to the download tab, name it, and click download.
You can then share the format json with others, and they can add it to their formats.
